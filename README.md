# node-brigadier-commands

A port of the [Brigadier](https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier) library to Node. It was hand-translated from the original Java source code, and as such its codebase and API is very similar to that of the original library.

This is very work-in-progress, and I wouldn't say the API is stable yet. It's probably unstable for now, so use this at your own risk!
